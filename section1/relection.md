## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- The SuperLearner Article resonated with my desire to be an efficient and effective learner.

  Specifically, I'd like to adopt the habit of reading, being intentional about breaks, and teaching others what I am learning. Unlike the rest of the habits, which I already put to practice, these three habits are not currently things that do. Since graduating high school reading is not a part of my regular rhythm, at least not in the sense of books. However, reading is an activity I enjoy when I dedicate space to do it. Therefore, my takeaway is that I need to carve out a dedicated space in my schedule for reading. That way I will start to build the habit and benefit from its positive impact on my learning. Similarly, I have already started to implement the practice of "Pomodoro Breaks" into my calendar. Its only been a few days thus far, but I've already recognized the positive effect it has had on my productivity! Likewise, following week one of Mod 0 I spent the better part of Saturday morning teaching my girlfriend and my mom what Git what is, which actually helped solidify my own understanding of it. Given this, I would like to try and get into the habit of teaching my family about what I am learning (_provided they care to learn/listen_).

  I don't think I would add anything to the list that isn't already included in it. The article's list is complete summation of the habits and practices that define a super learner.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- The data types I learned about in this section are the `Number`, `String`, and `Boolean` data types.
  1. The `Number` data types encompasses all numerical operations within the Javascript language.

  2. The `String` data type is the broadest of the three data types we learned about. It can house all kinds of text (e.g. numbers, characters, special characters, etc.). However, a there are clear distinction between a number that is a `String` vs. one that is a `Number`. The latter has mathematical value/function, whereas the prior does not. `Strings` are implemented in Javascript by housing text within quotes.

  3. The `Boolean` data type is simplest of the three data types as only two values are possible: `true` or `false`. The `Boolean` is used for logical operations within code.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- 2 ways to comment within Javascript:
  1. //You can comment this way with double forward slashes
    **or**
  2. /*You can comment like this, enclosed in a forward slash and asterisk*/

- The purpose of code comments is two fold as well:
  1. Comments are used to either impart information about our code, to other developers, in our code.
    **or**
  2. De-activate parts of our code which we want to temporarily keep from running.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is a vessel for storing values.

  I would explain to a 5 year old that a variable is like book. They hold important information that can be retrieved/referenced when working on a tasks that involve the information stored in the book.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- My messages app likely uses the following three variables:
  1. `contactName` //this would be a `String`
  2. `contactNumber` //this would be a `Number`
  3. `is_favorite` //this would be a 'Boolean' because a contact either is or is not a favorited contact

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- Concatenation is a method of joining together `Strings` in Javascript.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
- Youtube likely used concatenation to display a channels number of subscribers underneath the channel name.
  //perhaps something like console.log(num_Of_Subscribers + " subscribers");

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- What other data types are there in Javascript?
- What is the reason behind having two methods of injecting values into `Strings`? (Interpolation & Concatenation)
- Can you re-assign data types to variables like you can their values?
