## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Two points that stuck out to me from the article were
  striving to improve from within my Zone of Proximal Development(ZPD) and that mistakes are essential to learning.

  Prior to reading the article I had never heard of ZPD, but now I find the concept resonates with me. Something I struggle with is the fear of being given a task or a project that I have no idea how to complete. However, this fear is irrational. As the article suggests, I won't be tasked with problems that are completely beyond my ability to accomplish them. In reality, I'll face challenges/projects that are within my realm of expertise, but also push me a little beyond my scope. The beauty of this arrangement is that by virtue of accomplishing these projects my knowledge and skill-base will gradual expand. Hence, learning about ZPD and that my goal is simply to strive to improve with in it, helps quiet my fear!

  Interestingly, at its core my fear is tied to failing/failure. The fear of failing is something that I've had for as long as I can remember. That is why since learning about what a growth mindset, I have endeavored to adopt one. Theoretically I grasp and understand how mistakes/failing are essential to process of learning. However, accepting that idea personally, moreover putting it into practice, is very difficult. I don't like to mess up or make mistakes. It's something I've spent my whole academic career working to avoid. However, I realize now that my fear of failing no longer serves me well, but rather restricts me. It makes me afraid to explore and experiment out of the fear of falling short. That may have been true before, but it is no longer. I'm committed to continue to the process of replacing my fixed mindset with a growth oriented one.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- At its core, the belief that I can evolve my view of  
  failure from one that is fixed to one that is growth oriented is a clear demonstration of a growth mindset. In addition, I exhibit a growth mindset on my continual journey to grow in my understanding and knowledge of cultural/life experiences different than my own.

- As I mentioned above the biggest way in which I still
  have a fixed mindset is in my view of failure/failing. Being accepting of making mistakes, and choosing to see it as a learning opportunity vs. a source of shame, is something that I work on daily. It's a slow and arduous process, but I grow better at it with each day.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Profile settings. Arrays are variables that can store
  a collection of values. A person's profile page is a collection of values that are all related through their purpose in providing information about the person whose profile it is. Therefore, an array seems perfectly suited to house all of these related values.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- Array methods are ready-made functions that can be
  called to edit the structure and/or values of a specified array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- The purpose of a loop is to improve efficiency. They
  provide developers with the ability to automate repetitive tasks, greatly saving them both time and line space in their script.
- We use loops in combination with arrays, when we need
  to perform the same function on or with each piece of data housed in the array. Loops allow us to iterate through the array for a specified number of times to automate this process.
- When using loops not in conjunction with arrays their
  purpose is much the same: they allows developers to streamline repetitive tasks through automation.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- Loops are like a well trained dog. Similarly to how a
  dog will play "dead" until they receive the command that they've been taught means stop, a loop will execute a specified command for as long as it is specified to do so by a provided condition. Once the condition is fulfilled or no longer true the loop will stop executing its command.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- What is a use case for a `Do...While` loop? Its main
  difference from a `while` loop is that it will always run the statements inside its curly braces at least once ***even if the condition evaluates to false.*** What's an example of an instance in which this feature is useful/wanted?
