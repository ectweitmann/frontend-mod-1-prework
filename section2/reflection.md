## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I think that I tend to land on the side of waiting too long. I take glee in solving problems myself, so I tend to hold off asking questions until I absolutely need to/become demoralized. Sometimes that has meant I spend hours searching/attempting to solve my problem, that would have been a 2 minute fix if I'd just asked for help. That being said, there are also times that I avoid asking questions simply because I don't want to come off inept. Thus, my biggest takeaway from reading those blog posts is to value my time. If I am making progress on a problem, great I'll continue marching on. However, if I find myself 20-30 minutes into trying to solve a problem and I am just as stuck as I was at the beginning, I'm gonna step back and  ask for help!

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- It felt good. I'm not uncomfortable with unguided learning. I've taught myself how to do complex things in the past. Nevertheless, I still do value some direction which I thought there was plenty of in this section. Moreover, I write thorough notes and I am highly attentive to details. Thus, I didn't need to be told to run my file in node or anything like that because I had already made a note of the procedural step while I was working on Section 1.

- In addition, I was a computer science major my freshman year of college during which the language I learned was Javascript. As a result, almost everything we've covered this far has been review, not new information, so I feel very comfortable with the concepts.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement follows the formula of if x, then y. For example, if I pop my car tire, then I can't drive my car.
- A conditional statement is probably used in Marco Polo to keep or remove the red dot that indicates an unwatched video message. If the video is watched then it is removed, otherwise (else) keep the red dot.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- You multiple conditions to an `if` statement by chaining `if else` statements.
- The program will start at the top, with the original `if` statement. If its condition is true it will execute its code block and ignore the following conditions and pick up executing the remainder of the script. However, if the first `if` statement is false, then the program will move on to the next immediate `if else` statement and repeat the above process if its condition is true. This procedure continues until the program reaches an `if else` statement that is true, or until it reaches the `else` statement at which time it executes the `else` statement's instructions then moves on to the remainder of the script.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- The && (AND) logical operator and the || (OR) logical operator.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- Like I said above, I have previously learned about `if` statements and functions and feel I have a solid understanding of both at this time.
