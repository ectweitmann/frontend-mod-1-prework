//-------------------
// PART 1: Function Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: Write a function below that, when called will log "Severus Snape" to the console
function printName() {
  console.log("Severus Snape");
}

printName();
printName();
printName();
printName();
// Since the function was called 4 times, "Severus Snape" will log 4 times.


// YOU DO: Write a function named sayHello that logs to the console "Oh, Hello!"
// Then, call the function 2 times.
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Oh, Hello!");
}

sayHello();
sayHello();
//-------------------
// PART 2: Arguments and Parameters
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Write a function named greetMe that takes an argument, a String, of a name.
// The function should print out the value of the String that was passed in.
// Then, call the function 3 times, each time, passing it a different name.
function greetMe(name) {
  console.log(name);
}

greetMe("Ethan");
greetMe("Emaly");
greetMe("Dumbledore");
// YOU DO: Write a function that takes in 2 numbers as arguments, Numbers, and logs their sum
// Then, call that function 3 times, each time, passing in 2 different Numbers.
function sum(num1, num2) {
  console.log(num1 + num2);
}

sum(2, 2);
sum(6, 8);
sum(99, 1);
// YOU DO🎈: Write a function that takes in two strings and prints a concatenation
// of those two strings, for example the arguments could be ("Oscar", "Ruck") and
// the end result might be "Oscar and Ruck are BFFS".  Then, call that function.
function tellSecret(name1, name2) {
  console.log("You'd never guess, but " + name1 + " and " + name2 + " are evil twins!");
}

tell_Secret("Archibald", "Xavier");
//-------------------
// PART 3: Naming is Hard
//-------------------

/*
Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough
that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DO🎈 - what did you name the function, and why?
What did you name each parameter, and why?

EXPLAIN:
I named my function tell_Secret and its parameters name1 and name2. The reason I chose to name my function tell_Secret is
because that is what my function does: it tells a secret about the two people who's names are passed as arguments. Hence
why I named my parametes name1 and name2 because names are what are being concatenated into the secret that is logged by
tell_Secret.
